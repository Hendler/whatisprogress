  &lt;strong&gt;fix problems with the user experiences&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      small visual problems can make people &amp;#8230; disgusted. Fonts, cross browser issues take a lot of time, but matter to people who expect things to work.??
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      client (browser) speed &amp;#8211; a small javascript issue can cause a page load to appear to take 5 seconds. &lt;em&gt;Perceived&lt;/em&gt; performance is all that matters.??
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      fix display issues &amp;#8211; if they think data is lost, then it is??
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      integrated QA team &amp;#8211; make everyone on the team test the site, but not their own work.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;make coding fast&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      establish team communication that makes product iteration rapid
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      use frameworks, existing but stable libraries (open source so you can fix critical problems yourself)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      keep version control and deployment as automated as possible for the whole team
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      write easy to understand code
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      document code and best practices (wiki style)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      track problems (bugs and backlogs)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      write test code (on critical areas)
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;housekeeping&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      refactor
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      cleanup
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      more test code
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;new features/ scaling/performance&lt;/strong&gt;??- probably the most fun for an engineer, but last on the list. This has been the hardest for me. ??Engineers need to think about scaling when the system is architected&amp;#8230;. maybe. But when you have just a 10 customers and the entire database fits in memory&amp;#8230; why worry? &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      database ??- a typical bottleneck. NoSQL and distributed architectures are making this easier
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      separate web server from application layer. Concentrate core application logic into languages that are better suited for scaling and concurrency issues
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      load balance, messaging queues, etc
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    Because of the list above, not every engineer out of a great tech school or amazing high tech corporation adjusts to startup life well. But when the above begins to pay dividends, engineers appreciate the big picture.
