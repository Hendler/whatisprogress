<a href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/132479.html" target="_blank">Norman Borlaug</a> recently passed away, and has perhaps saved millions of lives by improving food crop productivity. Fifty years later, a tremendous amount of science has been done since then. The Green in Green Revolution might not be appropriate any more.

Contributions to science can to be viewed as non-political and amoral. But there is a polarization and politicization of organic and &#8220;industrial&#8221; agriculture. My opinion is that the fundamental issue is sustainability. I think the course correction for industry still needs to be sustainability (economic, environmental and social)

If you are into agriculture &#8211; (food sources in general) &#8211; the video below is an interesting interview with Norman&#8217;s neighbors on the impact of chemical farming on soil and sustainability.

As a technologist from rural Maine, I like to keep in touch with ecology/agriculture topics. (my post at  <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=820725" target="_blank">hacker news </a>)
