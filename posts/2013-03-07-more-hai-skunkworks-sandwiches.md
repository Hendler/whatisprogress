For a few weeks I&#8217;ve been having meetings with advisors and colleagues. For those I&#8217;ve not been meeting, I&#8217;ve fallen behind in communicating [what I&#8217;m working on][1].

Not a stealth startup, but there&#8217;s also a lot that&#8217;s yet to be determined. I&#8217;d prefer to be open, but there are some specifications that I&#8217;ll keep under wraps for a variety of reasons&#8230;. When building a stealth aircraft, at the least you can tell people that you are building an aircraft. Skunkworks doesn&#8217;t make sandwiches.

Company vision and culture will be in large part determined by cofounders. Here&#8217;s where there&#8217;s some definition:

  * HAI means AAI (Artificial Artificial Intelligence)  &#8211; humans intelligence built into a process that&#8217;s usable by computer intelligence
  * Ethical prime directives.  See [Friendly AI][2]
  * a sustainable business model early on
  * Company culture of sustainable innovation modeled after Google&#8217;s large revenue generating platform supporting R&D.
  * large, very talented, diverse founding team. Diversity is a no-brainer. Large is about five people; I&#8217;d rather create value from equity by distributing to founders than funders.
  * Boston still has untapped talent and potential. Even if developers can find jobs easily, what kind of job would an engineer want for the rest of their life?
