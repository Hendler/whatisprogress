[Disrupting Class][1] was an excellent resource in providing a technology and business vocabulary which is applicable to the deep challenges facing public education today.

To be honest, my view of education is emotive as it  represents so many formative years of my life. I can not claim to bring objectivity to the dialogue. A relative writing [&#8220;Freedom to Learn&#8221;][2], as well as my mother being a retired special education teacher &#8230; I&#8217;m biased.

But it is as a technologist, sitting on the cusp of big change, that I can read with sense of calling &#8211; knowing that as a CTO of [Better Lesson][3] I&#8217;m privileged to be in the kind of position coveted by catalysts of renaissance, and admirers of diversity &#8211; where once there was only one word &#8211; philosophy. Besides the need to avenge my childhood (where I was to have skipped two grades, but also had the diplomacy of a Tasmanian Devil combined with winning the award for &#8220;Teachers Pest&#8221;, an award created just for me if I remember), maybe now I can make a lot of folks _happy_.

This is the kind of book that makes me happy. Happy to me is a wholestic thing. I want to make a lot of money without others suffering. I want to pursue knowledge that sustainably changes the world.
