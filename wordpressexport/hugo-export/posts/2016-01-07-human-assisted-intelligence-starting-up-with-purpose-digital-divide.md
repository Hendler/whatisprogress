<span style="font-weight:400;">It’s not news here in San Francisco,  in the most dominant region of the Silicon World &#8211; </span>**I’m creating a company**<span style="font-weight:400;">. I have built a prototype. I’ve tested with users. I&#8217;m no miracle worker, and there’s a long, long way to go. And I&#8217;ve got <strong>just a couple of months</strong> to get off the ground.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">What makes it worthwhile is the mission.</span>

**End the Digital Divide**

The Digital Divide will end. The question is &#8220;Why?&#8221;. Even with rapid, global smartphone growth and internet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/solarimpulse" target="_blank">from</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/loon/" target="_blank">the sky</a>, there&#8217;s so much important work to be done to learn, educate and protect.

<span style="font-weight:400;">If we work very very hard, and are very very lucky, only a minuscule part of the world will progress because of our efforts. That part matters. </span>

Starting a company, especially as a parent, isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart. <span style="font-weight:400;">I would be grateful for your feedback and support. Reach out to startup@hai.io, f</span>ollow at <a href="https://twitter.com/humanassisted" target="_blank">@humanassisted</a> or me <a href="https://twitter.com/hendler" target="_blank">@hendler</a>
