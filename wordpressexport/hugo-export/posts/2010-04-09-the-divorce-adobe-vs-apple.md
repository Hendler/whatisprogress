Apple and Adobe are both claiming a moral high-ground.

At first [Adobe was the bad-guy][1] for allegedly blocking further development of open standards [like HTML5][2] and [not opening up Flash][3].

<div>
  Now, according to Adobe, <a href="http://theflashblog.com/?p=1888">Apple is the bad guy</a> for not including flash and limiting development options for the iPhone (and iPad).

  These are sad times because many are feeling like children of divorcees. Adobe and Apple have long provided shelter for creative geeks. Now the shelter is a crumbling, confusing world. Business and technology, especially when mixed, are sufficiently complex as to seem like magic. No magic here. Each company is changing, and getting over each other. Sorry lads. While tech-magic is love (translate: we will pay for magic, but nothing else) the magic eventually fades. The beginning of the fade is what I&#8217;ll call the magic line &#8211; the line between illusion, and disillusion. Adobe&#8217;s magic may be disappearing.

    Is Adobe keeping up with demand for product improvements? Certainly, with software like Adobe&#8217;s, it is extremely difficult to sustainably write such complex software that runs the same, and well, on platforms you don&#8217;t control.

    Perhaps, Apple has more power and responsibility than it realizes. As leaders in tech, Apple straddles the most thorny complex issues like copyright, DRM, hardware, open source; as both an under-dog and monopoly of tech.

    There are reasons for the divorce, but they may not matter.
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Open source, open platforms, and open standards are really the only sustainable way forward.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I say this not to take sides. As developers and creatives we must make choices that protect our future. Protect does not mean &#8220;defend&#8221;. Protect here means &#8220;ensures sustainable happiness for all involved&#8221;. Our destinies are already intertwined, but intertwined should not feel like a lock-in, trap or prison. Freedom can co-exist with interdependence.

    At the least &#8211; businesses come and go, but openness wins.
