**&#8220;We now face the danger, which in the past has been the most destructive to the humans: Success, plenty, comfort, and ever-increasing leisure. No dynamic people has ever survived these dangers&#8221;** &#8211; [John Steinbeck][1]

Social networks and other internet communication has complex and distorted incentives. To use a term from political philosophy, consumer internet creates our modern &#8220;social fabric&#8221;.<sup data-fn="338c172c-31ab-4a9d-8c35-368f5d8a7c14" class="fn"><a href="#338c172c-31ab-4a9d-8c35-368f5d8a7c14" id="338c172c-31ab-4a9d-8c35-368f5d8a7c14-link">1</a></sup> The patterns of the fabric are based on market forces that serve human nature, but not always human needs. Content creators know that triggering a fear response, like outrage, is a very effective engagement strategy.<sup data-fn="faba225b-b95b-4fd2-87dc-2515d4604397" class="fn"><a href="#faba225b-b95b-4fd2-87dc-2515d4604397" id="faba225b-b95b-4fd2-87dc-2515d4604397-link">2</a></sup> Polarization creates toxicity and is already weaponized.  
  
AI will amplify everything. For better or worse, to express something to AI may allow us to see it in the world.<sup data-fn="0ae57a87-8916-4cd5-a909-75e04d1df32a" class="fn"><a href="#0ae57a87-8916-4cd5-a909-75e04d1df32a" id="0ae57a87-8916-4cd5-a909-75e04d1df32a-link">3</a></sup> 

**Social health is the measurement of social fabric over time.** Social health is not only the connection between individuals, but also can be broadly observed in the effectiveness and trustworthiness of our institutions. Also, it is the commitment to ourselves and our identities when interacting with social constructs.  
  
**Social health is my answer to the name of this website &#8211; &#8220;What is Progress?&#8221;** 

On the side, I&#8217;ve playing with ideas for [HAI.AI][2] for about 10 years, and ideas around AI to resolve conflict for 20 years. In the abstract, the function of HAI.AI is to generate and maintain &#8220;good&#8221; interpersonal commitments.&nbsp;<sup data-fn="d5f6cc8f-4551-4ed5-a38a-b7b225bb334d" class="fn"><a href="#d5f6cc8f-4551-4ed5-a38a-b7b225bb334d" id="d5f6cc8f-4551-4ed5-a38a-b7b225bb334d-link">4</a></sup>

Like many dedicating their careers to change, I&#8217;ve worked at startups in education technology, mental health care, and environmental air quality data. We built new technologies and experiences from scratch. We validated the efficacy. The primary challenge was the effectiveness of the institutions we connect with and rely on. How do you sell to an institution that can&#8217;t function sufficiently? Institutions with good people that do a good work; but inside and out, no one is as happy or as effective as they could be. We understandably want to keep our jobs and our identity, but change is constant.â€‚  
  
I am biased, perhaps beyond repair, but like many founders I&#8217;ve come to believe we need new institutions for large, critical human services. The bigger the institution the bigger the disruption needed. AI will bring that disruption, but AI will also produce an arms race. To be generous, we are just starting to understand what new challenges will come. Meanwhile, we must build what we will be fighting for.
