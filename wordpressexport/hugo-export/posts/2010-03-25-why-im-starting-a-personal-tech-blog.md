  Welcome.

  <a href="http://Supercalafragilisticexpialadocio.us">Supercalafragilisticexpialadocio.us</a> is for technologists, like myself, who enjoy the challenges that come with taking interesting ideas and bringing them to a wide audience.

  Currently I&#8217;m the CTO of a &#8220;lean&#8221; startup &#8211; <a href="http://betterlesson.org">http://betterlesson.org</a>.

  The work I&#8217;ll be posting is done in the context of startups. Startups are great. The definition l&#8217;ll use of &#8220;startup&#8221; is informal. By my definition, a startup is the adventure of working to make a sufficiently new idea self sustaining.

  Building a laboratory and having a fair shot at a large audience is no longer a barrier to entry.<strong>**</strong> Often, technologist&#8217;s education is almost entirely from peers on the Internet &#8211; piecing together technology that yesterday may have been out of reach.  With low barriers to entry comes a tremendous amount of competition.  What differentiates is not only technical skill, but ability to successfully navigate the technology world. Propaganda, pain, tunnel vision, and joy dot the fast-changing technology blogosphere. Execution is tough when the more ambitious ideas you have would be obsolete by the time you finish them. When do you keep exploring? When do you settle on a technology and dive in?
</div>

<div>
  I plan to dive into technology specifics, so this post is to set the tone. If I stray from my own ideas, tell me. I need your help.

<div>
  <ul class="MailOutline">
    <li>
      Technology alone is not enough: <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure you love something you consider to be <em>not</em> technology. Loving code and assembling lego blocks works for some of the best &#8211; but for mortals, having other interests can serve as a compass to guide the &#8220;why&#8221; you do what to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            Courage is not only in tackling cutting edge technologies, but also in shepherding the transition to new technology for the larger world we serve. Yes, I believe that world domination is a goal of every startup. But domination means we want to serve as many people possible, and do it well. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; is a mantra I reflect on in this context.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Be open: <ul>
        <li>
          Isolation is dangerous. Open source, open communities, and open style of development keep you healthy. Some &#8220;enemy&#8221; may occasionally out-calcuate you because you showed your hand. But you&#8217;ll lose a few games of poker in order to win the innovation game. Chances are if your idea is something some one _can_ steal simply by sharing the idea with them, then some one else is going independently invent it anyway.  Don&#8217;t live in fear that some one might be doing something newer or better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your reputation is important, but if some one can trash your idea easily it&#8217;s either because the idea is actually bad, or they are simply wrong.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    Looking forward to sharing the adventure.
